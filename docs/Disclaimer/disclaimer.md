# Disclaimer

The outputs generated by sDRIPS are primarily based on **satellite remote sensing data**, which can be affected by factors such as cloud cover, sensor limitations, and spatio-temporal resolution. While efforts are made to obtain the clearest and most accurate representation possible, the results should **not be assumed to be fully precise**.  

By default, sDRIPS uses **dynamic land use land cover (LULC) data from [Copernicus](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_Landcover_100m_Proba-V-C3_Global)**. Users should note that this dataset may not perfectly reflect current field conditions, and local variations may exist.  

sDRIPS is intended to provide **advisory guidance** and insights, leveraging **satellite and in-situ sensor data where available**. However, it should **not replace on-the-ground observations or expert judgment**, as local conditions may vary. Field observations should be used in conjunction with sDRIPS to make decisions based on both scientific data and experiential knowledge.
