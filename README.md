# satellite Data Rendered Irrigation using Penman and SEBAL (sDRIPS) 

sDRIPS is an open-source Python package that generates weekly, farm-scale (30â€¯m) irrigation advisories by integrating satellite observations, global weather models, and ground-based measurements when available. Its modular design supports diverse agricultural contexts and heterogeneous data inputs, allowing estimation of evapotranspiration, incorporation of precipitation forecasts, and calculation of net irrigation demand. sDRIPS is designed to make advanced irrigation planning accessible to farmers and canal operators of varying technical expertise, enabling optimized water use under climate uncertainty.

### Python Package
sDRIPS is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sdrips) and can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install sdrips
```
